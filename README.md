## Description
After going to the URL, a user will see an army green background before the header 'Employee Payroll Tracker' in dark bold lettering at the top-middle of the page. Below the heading is a long white box with 'Employee Roster' in dark bold lettering at the top. Directly beneath that is a thin, grey line sitting right above three evenly spaced titles: First Name, Last Name, Salary (respectively). There is a chunk of white space underneath the titles and then another thin grey line. A large blue button with 'Add Employee' in white lettering rests near the bottom of the box followed by a bit more white space.
